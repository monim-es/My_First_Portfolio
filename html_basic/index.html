  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is my very first paragraph on the web! It's exciting to learn HTML and start building things from scratch.</p>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This page is a simple demonstration of my new HTML skills. I'm learning how to structure content, add headings, and even embed images.</p>

  <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
  <p>There will be a few sections to show off paragraphs, headings, and images. Nothing fancy, just clean and valid HTML.</p>

  <p>Here’s a clickable image that takes you to the ALX website:</p>
